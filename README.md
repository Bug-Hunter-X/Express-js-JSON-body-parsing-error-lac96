# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The problem arises when the application fails to correctly parse the JSON data, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description
The application receives a POST request with JSON data in the body.  However, when attempting to access `req.body`, it remains empty or undefined, causing the application to fail to process the intended data.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the correct middleware is used to parse JSON data in the incoming request.  The `express.json()` middleware needs to be added before any route handlers that expect JSON data.
